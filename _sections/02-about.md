TO ALL PARISHONERS OF ST. VLADIMIR MEMORIAL CHURCH, AND TO ALL WHO MAY WISH TO VISIT ST.VLADIMIR MEMORIAL CHURCH:
<br><br>
DUE TO THE ON-GOING COVID-19 EPIDEMIC IN NJ, OUR DIOCESAN AUTHORITY HAS INSTRUCTED US THAT THE CHURCH MUST BE CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC FOR AN INDETERMINATE TIME-FRAME.
<br><br>
THIS DECISION TO TAKE SUCH DRASTIC ACTION IS NOT MADE LIGHTLY, BUT IS IN KEEPING WITH RECOMMENDATIONS OF CIVIL HEALTH AUTHORITIES, AND IS TAKEN WITH HOPE IN OUR LORD FOR THE GOOD OF OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBORS.
<br><br>
PLEASE BE ASSURED THAT ALL DIVINE SERVICES WILL REMAIN  AS SCHEDULED. THE MINIMAL STAFF NEEDED IN ORDER TO PROPERLY  EXECUTE THE SERVICES SHALL BE PRESENT.
<br><br>
WE CALL UPON ALL OF THE FAITHFUL TO PRAY HEARTFULLY TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, THAT HE MAY SEE US AND ALL OF SOCIETY THROUGH THIS CHALLENGING TIME, AND THAT HE MAY BESTOW HIS GREAT MERCY UPON THE SUFFERING.
MAY THE BLESSING OF OUR LORD BE WITH ALL OF YOU.
